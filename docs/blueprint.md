## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated green (#1DB954), drawing from Spotify's brand color, for energy and a direct tie-in to music.
- Background color: Dark gray (#121212), similar to the existing background, to maintain a modern look and reduce eye strain. This color is visibly of the same hue as the primary color, but heavily desaturated.
- Accent color: Light blue (#53A3C9), an analogous color that offers a cool contrast for highlights and interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to maintain a modern and readable aesthetic.
- Use minimalist, custom icons for each mood category in the mood cards to visually enhance the user experience.
- Maintain a clean and intuitive layout with a clear separation between the sidebar navigation and the main content area, optimizing for user engagement and ease of use.
- Subtle transitions and animations to create a smooth, engaging user experience when interacting with mood cards, chat messages, and music suggestions.
